## What is EvaP?

EvaP is the course evaluation system used internally at Hasso Plattner Institute at the University of Potsdam.

For the documentation, please see our [wiki](https://github.com/e-valuation/EvaP/wiki).


## Installation

The easiest setup using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) is shown here.

0. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html), and one of [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) (recommended) or [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (for ARM systems).

1. Fork the EvaP repository (using the Fork-button in the upper right corner on GitHub).

2. Windows users only (might not apply for the Linux subsystem):
   * Line endings: git's [`core.autocrlf` setting](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration#_core_autocrlf) has to be `false` or `input` so git does not convert line endings on checkout, because the code will be used in a Linux VM. We suggest using this command in Git Bash:

     ```bash
     git config --global core.autocrlf input
     ```

3. Run the following commands on the command line to clone the repository, create the Vagrant VM and run the Django development server.
   To use Docker, replace `vagrant up` with `vagrant up --provider docker && vagrant provision`.
   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/<your_github_username>/EvaP.git
   cd EvaP
   vagrant up
   vagrant ssh
   ./manage.py run
   ```

4. Open your browser at http://localhost:8000/ and login with email `evap@institution.example.com` and password `evap`.


That's it!

## Contributing

We'd love to see contributions, feel free to fork! You should probably branch off `main`, the branch `release` is used for stable revisions.

Before committing, run the following commands:
- `./manage.py test` (runs the test suite)
- `./manage.py lint` (runs linting)
- `./manage.py format` (applies automatic code formatting)

or, to combine all three, simply run `./manage.py precommit`.

You can also set up `pylint`, `isort`, `black` and `prettier` in your IDE to avoid doing this manually all the time.
