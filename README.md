## What is EvaP?

EvaP is the course evaluation system used internally at Hasso Plattner Institute at the University of Potsdam.

For the documentation, please see our [wiki](https://github.com/e-valuation/EvaP/wiki).


## Installation (for Development)

The easiest setup using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) is shown here.

1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html), and one of [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) (recommended) or [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (for ARM systems).

2. Run the following commands on the command line to clone the repository, create the Vagrant VM and run the Django development server.
   * If you are familiar with the fork-based open source workflow, create a fork and clone that (using SSH if you prefer that).

   * Windows users: We have observed [weird](https://www.github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/4705) [behavior](https://www.github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/4704) with SSH in Git Bash on Windows and thus recommend using PowerShell instead.

   * To use Docker, replace `vagrant up` with `vagrant up --provider docker && vagrant provision`.

   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/e-valuation/EvaP.git
   cd EvaP
   vagrant up
   vagrant ssh
   ```
   and, after the last command opened an SSH session in the development machine:
   ```bash
   ./manage.py run
   ```

3. Open your browser at http://localhost:8000/ and login with email `evap@institution.example.com` and password `evap`.

That's it!

## Contributing

We'd love to see contributions, feel free to fork! You should probably branch off `main`, the branch `release` is used for stable revisions.

Before committing, run the following commands:
- `./manage.py test` (runs the test suite)
- `./manage.py lint` (runs linting)
- `./manage.py format` (applies automatic code formatting)

or, to combine all three, simply run `./manage.py precommit`.

You can also set up `pylint`, `isort`, `black` and `prettier` in your IDE to avoid doing this manually all the time.

### Creating a Pull Request (Workflow Suggestion)
1. (once) [Fork](https://github.com/e-valuation/EvaP/fork) the repository so you have a GitHub repo that you have write access to.

2. (once) Set up some authentication for GitHub that allows push access. A common option is using [SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh), the remaining instructions assume an SSH key setup. An alternative is using the [GitHub CLI tool](https://cli.github.com/).

3. (once) Ensure your [git remotes](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes) are setup to use SSH. To fetch the up-to-date state of the official repo, it's useful to have an "upstream" remote configured:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<your-username>/EvaP.git
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:e-valuation/EvaP.git
   ```

4. Create a branch (`git switch -c <your-branch-name>`), commit your changes (`git add` and `git commit`), and push them (`git push`). "Push" will ask you to specify an upstream branch (`git push -u origin <your-branch-name>`).

5. GitHub should now ask you whether you want to open a pull request ("PR"). If the PR solves an issue, use one of GitHub's [magic keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) (like "fixes") in the pull request description to create a link between your PR and the issue. If necessary, please also provide a short summary of your changes in the description.
