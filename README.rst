Terminology used in EvaP
------------------------
- Each course will have a person **responsible for the course** (*Lehrveranstaltungs-Verantwortlicher*).
- **Delegates** (*Stellvertreter*) are persons assigned to other persons. A delegate always has all the rights that the person (or persons) he or she is assigned to has.
- All persons who are added to have teaching roles in a course (lecturers, tutors, etc.) are called **contributors** (*Beitragende*).
