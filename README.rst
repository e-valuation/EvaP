What is EvaP?
-------------

EvaP (a successor to the infamous EvaJ) is a course evaluation system used
internally at Hasso Plattner Institute.

For the documentation, please look into the *docs* subdirectory or the generated
documentation at ReadTheDocs: https://evap.readthedocs.org.

Installation
------------
The vagrant setup and a quick manual install are shown here. For more detailed instructions (including production deployment) see http://evap.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html.

(0) Checkout EvaP and its submodules::

        git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:fsr-itse/EvaP.git

Vagrant
~~~~~~~
(1) After installing Vagrant_, run in your EvaP root directory::

        vagrant up

(2) create yourself an admin account::

        vagrant ssh
        cd /vagrant
        python manage.py createsuperuser
        
(3) and open your browser::

        http://localhost:8000/

Manual Install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(1) simply install the requirements::

        pip install -r requirements.txt

(2) run the database initialization and migrations::

        python manage.py syncdb
        python manage.py migrate

(3) make the translations work::

        python manage.py compilemessages

(4) create yourself an admin account::

        python manage.py createsuperuser

(5) start the development server::

        python evap/manage.py runserver

(6) and open your browser::

        http://localhost:8000/

More detailed instructions (also covering production deployment) can be found at http://evap.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html.

Load test data in manual installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
The Vagrant VM automatically loads test data from a fixture on it's creation. If
you want to load this data in your manual installation, run the following
commands (*Note: This will remove all data previously stored in the database*)::

        python manage.py flush --no-initial-data
        python manage.py loaddata test_data.json

Mailinglist
-----------

We have a mailinglist evap-dev@lists.myhpi.de
