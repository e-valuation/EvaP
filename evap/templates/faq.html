    <h4>{% trans "What is evaluation?" %}</h4>
    <p>
        {% blocktrans %}
        It's the assessment of all the courses at the HPI. It's the goal to improve the teaching quality by giving the lecturers feedback for their courses.

    <h4>{% trans "Where are the data coming from?" %}</h4>
    <p>
        {% blocktrans %}
        The different information, imported into the system, are provided by the Studienreferat.<br>
        After that the lectures, their delegates or the student representatives correct any mistakes.<br>
        If you just found another error please contact the responsible lecturer or the student representatives.

    <h3>{% trans "Questionnaires" %}</h3>
    
    <a name="questionnaires_construction"></a>
    <h4>{% trans "How are questionnaires constructed?" %}</h4>
    <p>
        {% blocktrans %}
        Every questionnaire of a lecture consists of different sub-questionnaires, e.g. about the contents or the teaching assistant.<br>
        Each sub-questionnaire consists of one ore more questions.
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    
    <a name="kind_of_questions"></a>
    <h4>{% trans "What types of questions are there?" %}</h4>
    <p>
        {% blocktrans %}
        There are two general types of questions:<br>
        The first is called "Likert" and consists of five possible answers - from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree".
        Additionally there is the option to give <em>no answer</em>.<br>
        With the second type it is possible to leave text comments, if the other questions miss an interesting point.
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    
  
    <a name="questionnaires_assignment"></a>
    <h4>{% trans "How are questionnaires assigned to courses?" %}</h4>
    <p>
        {% blocktrans %}
        In general the assignment is done by the student representatives. But the lecturers can add additional questionnaires themselves, if they have special questions.
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    
    <h3>{% trans "Users" %}</h3>
    
    <a name="user_login"></a>
    <h4>{% trans "How do I log into the system?" %}</h4>
    <p>
        {% blocktrans %}
        If you are an HPI student or lecturer you can just use your usual credentials.<br>
        If you are an external student or lecturer you can get an access token by Email.
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    
    <a name="create_user"></a>
    <h4>{% trans "How are users registered? Who is able to create new users?" %}</h4>
    <p>
        {% blocktrans %}
        New users are created by the Student Representatives. Ask them if there is the need for new users.
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    
    <a name="delegate"></a>
    <h4>{% trans "What are delegates?" %}</h4>
    <p>
        {% blocktrans %}
        As professors do not have much time, it is possible for them to elect one or more delegates, e.g. a secretary or an employee of the chair.
        These people then can edit the courses as the original lecturer could, i.e. add questionnaires and setup the correct assistants and evaluation period.
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    
    <h3>{% trans "Publication of results" %}</h3>
    
    <a name="result_publication"></a>
    <h4>{% trans "How are the results publicised?" %}</h4>
    <p>
        {% blocktrans %}
        The results are viewable in the EvaP system, after the exams for the course are done.<br>
        Later the student representatives will hang out a hard copy of the results.
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    
    <a name="export"></a>
    <h4>{% trans "What information are in the printed export?" %}</h4>
    <p>
        {% blocktrans %}
        These prints contain the exact same information as shown in this system.<br>
        The involved lecturers can also view the comments, which were given to them.
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    
    <a name="overall_grade"></a>
    <h4>{% trans "How is the overall grade calculated?" %}</h4>
    <p>
        {% blocktrans %}
        The overall grade is the arithmetic average of all sub-grades.<br>
        All personal questions together are equally weighted to the questions about the course itself.
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    
    <a name="representativeness"></a>
    <h4>{% trans "How many answers are necessary to assure the representativeness?" %}</h4>
    <p>
        {% blocktrans %}
        Currently at least five (5) answers are necessary (except <em>no answer</em>) to assure the representativeness.<br>
        If you do not agree with that write an Email or just come over to start a discussion with the student representatives.
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    
    <h3>{% trans "Details for Lectures" %}</h3>
    
    <a name="course_data"></a>
    <h4>{% trans "What data are necessary for a course and why?" %}</h4>
    <p>
        {% blocktrans %}
        You can define all involved persons and their questionnaires. So it is possible for the students to give specific feedback.<br>
        The evaluation period can be changed to fit to specific important dates of the lecture.
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    
    <a name="evaluation_period"></a>
    <h4>{% trans "How should I configure the evaluation period of my course?" %}</h4>
    <p>
        {% blocktrans %}
        The evaluation must not influence the assessment of the students. So there are different criteria for the period:
        <ul>
            <li>It should end before the written exam or the first oral exam.</li>
            <li>It should be at least one week long.</li>
            <li>It should start after one of the last lectures and not right at the beginning or after every lecture is held.</li>
        </ul>
        Of course there are courses for which it is not possible to fulfil all of the criteria. Please contact the student representatives, if you are not sure.
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    
    <a name="course_state_model"></a>
    <h4>{% trans "What do the different course states mean?" %}</h4>
    <p>
        {% blocktrans %}
        There are eigth (8) different states a course can be in:
        <ol>
        <li><em>new:</em>
            Right after import or creation by the student representatives all courses are in this state. The student
            representatives new pre check these information and changes the course into the next state. This is
            mainly "pending for lecturer approval". If this happens an Email is sent to the lecturers.</li>
        <li><em>prepared:</em>
            In this state the lecturers can edit their courses, i.e. add and remove participants or change the
            evaluation period. If necessary the student representatives can approve the course, changing the
            state to "approved by FSR".</li>
        <li><em>lecturer approved by lecturer:</em>
            After a lecturer approved a course the student representatives are checking the data and finally
            approve the course themselves.</li>
        <li><em>approved:</em>
            After a course is approved (by the student representatives ultmatly) it is in this state. It will get
            into the next state automatically, if the start of the evaluation period is reched.</li>
        <li><em>in evaluation:</em>
            In this state the participants can give their answers.</li>
        <li><em>evaluated:</em>
            After the end of the evaluation period is reached, the course will get into this state automatically.
            Here the student representatives have to review all comment to remove inappropriate comments.</li>
        <li><em>reviewed:</em>
            Only after the grades are published by the lecturers the courses can be published by the student representatives.</li>
        <li><em>published:</em>
            Finally the results are here available in the system and the printout can be done, if nearly all courses
            are in this state.</li>
        </ol>
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    
    <a name="email_notice"></a>
    <h4>{% trans "When will I get which Email notice?" %}</h4>
    <p>
        {% blocktrans %}
        At some point in the middle of the semester you get an Email with all your courses to edit them if needed.<br>
        You will also get an Email after the results are available.
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    
    <a name="results_for_lecturers"></a>
    <h4>{% trans "Which results do I see and what do they mean?" %}</h4>
    <p>
        {% blocktrans %}
        You can see the average grade and standard deviation of all Likert questions.<br>
        Additionally you can view the comments the students gave to you, the course or the other people involved in the course.
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    
    <h3>{% trans "Details for Students" %}</h3>
    
    <a name="questionnaire_completeness"></a>
    <h4>{% trans "How complete do I have to fill in the questionnaires?" %}</h4>
    <p>
        {% blocktrans %}
        As complete as possible :)<br><br>
        The results are only published if the representativeness is guaranteed.
        All Likert questions need to be answered (at least with <em>no answer</em>), but not one text comment question, to submit an questionnaire.
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    
    <a name="comments"></a>
    <h4>{% trans "What happens to my comments?" %}</h4>
    <p>
        {% blocktrans %}
        As we cannot assure the representativeness or anonymity here all comments are provided to all people involved in the course they were given.<br>
        But the student representatives reserve the possibility to remove or change insults or other inappropriate texts.
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    
    <a name="anonymity"></a>
    <h>{% trans "How anonymous is my vote?" %}</h4>
    <p>
        {% blocktrans %}
        The system guarantees that there is no connection between a vote and a user.
        It is just stored which user already submitted which questionnaire.
        Pay attention: We cannot assure anonymity regarding text comment questions as it is possible for
        the lecturer to guess from the contest or grammar of the text the student writing it.
        <br><br>
        All text answers are given in an arbitrary order - so you should not refer to your own answers (like "see above" or "same as other teaching assistant").
