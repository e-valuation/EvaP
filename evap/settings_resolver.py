    By default, Django settings are configured in a module like
    ```python
    DEBUG = True
    DATADIR = Path("./data")
    STATIC_ROOT = DATADIR / "static_collected"
    ```

    This interface works for simple setups, but lacks some features that we desire. Most importantly, we want to declare
    a set of default settings that do not necessarily need to be changed when deploying EvaP. Some of these settings
    depend on other settings though, for example the STATIC_ROOT setting above depends on the DATADIR setting. If users
    would change the value of DATADIR, they would also have to reassign STATIC_ROOT accordingly.

    To resolve this issue, we provide the SettingResolver which takes setting modules and aggregates them into a final
    mapping of settings to pass to Django. Notably, the input modules to the resolver can explicitly declare
    dependencies between settings using the `@derived` decorator. Concretely, the settings are organized into different
    layers. Later layers overwrite previous settings. A derived setting can then declare a dependency on another setting
    value from either the previous layer (for example to append an entry to a list) or the final layer (for example to
    use a path overwritten by the user).

    To compute the final set of setting values, we form a dependency graph on the settings and layers and compute the
    according values in topological order.

    Note that the SettingResolver class is generic over the type of the setting values T, however we only use it below
    with T = Any. The type T is only used to track at what times values can still be derived.
