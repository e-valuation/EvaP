    - E501  # line too long - we don't enforce some fixed line length but rather complain about long lines in reviews.
    - W503  # line break before operator - looks better and PEP8 allows it
    - E128  # hanging indents not allowed - we indent differently
    - E126  # overindentation - we indent differently
    - N802  # function name should be lowercase - lots of false positives in tests that pylint doesn't show
    - N803  # argument name should be lowercase - pylint has this as well (and there we tweaked it)
    - N806  # variable in function should be lowercase - lots of false positives, mostly Formset classes made from factories
    - N804  # first argument of a classmethod should be named 'cls' - one false positive and pylint does it better
    - E266  # too many leading '#' for block comment - that's used in settings on purpose
