The documents in this folder contain the requirements from the different 
stakeholders of the system. They should be considered for the further 
development.

These documents are the results of the Requirements Engineering seminar
held in the winter term 2012/2013. This is also the the reason for why 
the language in those documents is GERMAN. English translation is not planned.
