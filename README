EvaP - Evaluation Platform
==========================

What is EvaP?
-------------

EvaP (a successor to the infamous EvaJ) is a course evaluation system used 
internally at Hasso Plattner Institute.

Source Structure
----------------

EvaP is a standard Django project, divided up into several applications:

- *evaluation* contains all the data models relevant for the evaluation, but 
  no views. 
- *fsr* provides views for the student representatives
- *results* provides views to show results and produce exports
- *student* provides views relevant for students (voting etc.)

Data Model and Migration
------------------------

The `evaluation` app is controlled by South -- a framework for Django that 
allows a continuous change in the data models without losing data.

Dependencies
------------

EvaP is written in Python using the Django framework. It has the following 
dependencies:

- Python 2.6
- Django 1.3
- South 0.7.3
- PIL 1.1.7
- xlrd 0.7.1

- WebTest 1.3, WebOb 1.1.1
